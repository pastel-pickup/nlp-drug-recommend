# PeopleSay: A Drug Recommendation System For The People By The People

# Question/Need:
# What is the question behind your analysis or model and what practical impact will your work have?
- What drugs do people react positively to, give positive reviews for, and want to recommend for a particular medical condition? 
- This drug recommendation system serves as a clinical decision support (CDS) system to help both healthcare providers and patients to be more informed in choosing the most appropriate drugs for the patient's medical conditions. This PeopleSay drug recommendation system will serve as a backup reference to supplement the medical knowledge of the healthcare providers, and to help them make better decisions for their patients, allow them to spend more quality care time together, and to improve the overall care experience of the patient. 

# Who is your client and how will that client benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
- My client is CVS, which is looking to provide more online healthcare services for its customers. Both of the healthcare provider and the customer of CVS could benefit from this PeopleSay recommendation system to help them pick out drugs that are most suitable for them.
